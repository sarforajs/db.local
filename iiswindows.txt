🖥️ ON WINDOWS SERVER (Web Server Setup)
🔹 Step 1: Install IIS (Internet Information Services)
Open Server Manager → Click Add Roles and Features.

Click Next until you reach Server Roles.

Check Web Server (IIS) → Click Next.

In Features, just click Next.

On the Confirmation page, click Install.

Wait for installation to complete → Click Close.

🔹 Step 2: Create a Website Folder
Open C:\inetpub\wwwroot (default IIS web root folder).

Create or replace the index.html file with your custom content, e.g.:

html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>My Server Website</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to IIS Web Server</h1>
</body>
</html>
🔹 Step 3: Start IIS and Test Locally
Press Win + R, type inetmgr, and hit Enter to open IIS Manager.

In the Connections pane, expand your server → Sites → Default Web Site.

Right-click Default Web Site → Click Browse.

A browser will open with http://localhost — you should see your web page.

🔹 Step 4: Allow Firewall Access (Optional for Testing)
Open Control Panel → Windows Defender Firewall.

Click Allow an app or feature → Ensure World Wide Web Services (HTTP) is allowed for Private and Public networks.

🔹 Step 5: Find Server IP
Run this in Command Prompt:

c
Copy
Edit
ipconfig
Note the IPv4 Address, e.g., 192.168.1.10.

🖥️ ON CLIENT MACHINE
🔹 Step 1: Access Server Website via Browser
Open any browser.

Type:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://<server-ip>
Example: http://192.168.1.10

You should see the same website hosted from the server.

✅ OPTIONAL: If You Want to Use IIS on Client for Web Deploy (rare in exams)
Install IIS on client from Windows Features.

Use tools like Web Deploy to publish to server, but for most practicals browser access is enough.
