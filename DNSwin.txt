CONFIGURE DNS IN WINDOWS SERVER
GOAL:
Set up a DNS Server on Windows Server to resolve hostnames like www.mycompany.local within a local network and allow client machines to use it.

ON WINDOWS SERVER
Step 1: Install DNS Server Role
Open Server Manager.

Click Add Roles and Features.

Click Next until you reach Server Roles.

Select DNS Server and click Next.

Continue through the wizard and click Install.

Once installed, click Close.

Step 2: Open DNS Manager
Press Win + R, type dnsmgmt.msc, and press Enter.

The DNS Manager console will open.

Step 3: Create a Forward Lookup Zone
In DNS Manager, expand the server node.

Right-click Forward Lookup Zones and choose New Zone.

Zone Type: Choose Primary Zone, click Next.

Zone Name: Enter your domain name (e.g., mycompany.local), click Next.

Zone File: Use the default, click Next.

Dynamic Updates: Choose Do not allow dynamic updates for simplicity, click Next, then Finish.

Step 4: Add a Host (A) Record
Right-click on the zone you just created (e.g., mycompany.local), select New Host (A or AAAA).

Name: Enter the hostname (e.g., www).

IP Address: Enter the IP of your web server (e.g., 192.168.1.10).

Click Add Host, then Done.

This creates a mapping: www.mycompany.local → 192.168.1.10.

Step 5 (Optional): Create a Reverse Lookup Zone
Right-click Reverse Lookup Zones, select New Zone.

Zone Type: Choose Primary Zone, click Next.

Select IPv4 Reverse Lookup Zone, click Next.

Enter the Network ID (for 192.168.1.0/24, use 192.168.1), click Next.

Use the default zone file name, click Next.

Choose Do not allow dynamic updates, click Next, then Finish.

You can now add PTR records if needed.

ON CLIENT MACHINE
Step 1: Set the Server as DNS
Go to Control Panel → Network and Sharing Center → Change Adapter Settings.

Right-click on the active network adapter and choose Properties.

Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties.

Choose Use the following DNS server addresses and enter the DNS server’s IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10).

Click OK.

Step 2: Test DNS Resolution
Open Command Prompt and run:

cmd
Copy
Edit
ping www.mycompany.local
If everything is set up correctly, it should resolve to the server’s IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
