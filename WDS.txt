Gpt answer  
✅ ON WINDOWS SERVER
🔹 Step 1: Install Data Deduplication Feature
Using Server Manager:

Open Server Manager → Click Add Roles and Features.

Proceed to Server Roles → Expand File and Storage Services → File and iSCSI Services.

Tick Data Deduplication → Click Next → Install.

Or via PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Install-WindowsFeature FS-Data-Deduplication
🔹 Step 2: Enable Data Deduplication on a Volume
Open Server Manager → Go to File and Storage Services → Volumes.

Right-click on the volume (e.g., D:) → Configure Data Deduplication.

Select:

General purpose file server

Choose file age (e.g., deduplicate files older than 5 days)

Set a schedule or leave default

Or via PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Enable-DedupVolume -Volume "D:"
🔹 Step 3: Manually Start Deduplication Job (Optional)
powershell
Copy
Edit
Start-DedupJob -Volume "D:" -Type Optimization
🔹 Step 4: Share the Folder for Client Access
Create a folder on the deduplicated volume (e.g., D:\SharedData).

Right-click → Properties → Sharing tab → Advanced Sharing.

Check Share this folder, give it a name like SharedData.

Set Permissions to allow client access.

✅ ON CLIENT MACHINE
🔹 Step 1: Map the Network Drive
Open File Explorer → This PC → Map Network Drive.

Choose a drive letter (e.g., Z:) and path:

🔹 Step 1: Open File Explorer
On the client machine, press Win + E to open File Explorer.

🔹 Step 2: Click on “This PC”
In the left panel, click This PC to see all drives.

At the top, click on the “Map network drive” button.

🔹 Step 3: Choose a Drive Letter
From the dropdown, select a drive letter (e.g., Z: or any free letter).

This letter will appear in File Explorer like any other drive.

🔹 Step 4: Enter the Folder Path
In the Folder field, type the shared folder path from your server.

Example:

Copy
Edit
\\SERVERNAME\SharedData
Replace SERVERNAME with the actual name or IP address of your server.

If your server's IP is 192.168.1.10, then type:

Copy
Edit
\\192.168.1.10\SharedData
🔹 Step 5: Check “Reconnect at sign-in”
This ensures the shared drive is automatically reconnected every time the client restarts or logs in.

🔹 Step 6: Click “Finish”
Windows will try to connect to the shared folder.

If prompted, enter the server username and password (e.g., Administrator).

Once connected, the new drive (like Z:\) will show up in This PC.

✅ Now the Client Can:
Open the Z:\ drive and save files.

All files saved here will be stored on the server, and deduplication will apply automatically.

🔹 Step 2: Use the Shared Folder
Save files directly to the mapped drive (Z:\).

All data saved here is deduplicated automatically on the server.

✅ Verification
On Server:
Check deduplication status:

open powershell

Get-DedupStatus -Volume "D:"
View savings:

open powershell

Get-DedupStatus | Select Volume, SavedSpace, OptimizedFilesCount
